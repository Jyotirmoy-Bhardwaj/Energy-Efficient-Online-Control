# Energy Efficient Online Control of a WDN
<p align=justify>
In this work, we show how to derive a cost-efficient pump control trajectory online for a water distribution network. 
Using `conda`, `tensorflow` can be installed as follows (for beginners):
```
$ conda create -n tf tensorflow
$ conda activate tf
```


# Requirements:
- [`TensorFlow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [`Keras`](https://keras.io/)
- [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/devdocs/)
- [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`jupyter`](https://jupyter.org/)

## Installation
This framework is suitable for Python >= 3.7 environment. In addition, the historical time series data is obtained from the designed IoT infrastructure; which is not demonstrated in this repository.
